# PyGE
Welcome to PyGE (Python Game Engine) created by [CPSuperstore](http://cpsuperstore.pythonanywhere.com/)!

## Overview
This engine has technically been in development for more than 3 years, but has been scrapped and completly re-built from scratch more than 5 times!

The aim of PyGE is to build a game engine, which is both simple, and complex. The engine was designed to handle all of the nitty-gritty low-level boring stuff, while allowing the user to access, modify, and re-build all of that if they are crazy enough to do so.

The engine is here to promote a community of like-minded Python PC game developers (or any developers, for that matter). We charge nothing to use the engine, but we ask for a 10% donation of whatever money you make from an applicaion built in this engine.

Our goal is to provide you with whatever tools you require to build the game of your dreams, weather it be a game where you stare at a dot for an hour (See: Stare At The Dot), or a game where you fight spaceships in a huge arena (See: [GWD](https://store.steampowered.com/app/786120/Galaxy_Wide_Domination/))

## Getting Started
There is plenty of documentation available, which can be found on the [PyGE](http://pyge.pythonanywhere.com/) Website, and on the [PyGE Forums](http://pygeforums.pythonanywhere.com/) Webiste.

## Examples
Here is a list of games which were built in PyGE. Feel free to contact me to have your game added to this list. I would be happy to add it!
* Galaxy Wide Domination (Coming Soon)
